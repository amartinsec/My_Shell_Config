# My Shell Config
For my new VM's 

- Installs Oh-My-ZSH with custom funky theme
- Enables git, colorize, and catimg plugins
- Installs cowsay with  handselected .cow's
- Adds a nice fortune quote in cowsay upon starting a shell:

This will make the changes for the account that executes make_changes.sh.
To make changes for the root account, run with sudo. 

### Use
`chmod +x make_changes.sh`
`./make_changes.sh`
<br>
You can use any .cows you want by adding them to `/usr/share/cowsay/cows`

<br>

Additional .cow's came from https://github.com/paulkaefer/cowsay-files/. I had to trim some of the full-color .cow's up to fit nicely in my terminal.
