# My_Shell_Config
For my new VM's 

- Installs Oh-My-ZSH with custom funky theme
- Enables git, colorize, and catimg plugins
- Installs cowsay with  handselected .cow's
- Adds a nice fourtune quote in cowsay upon starting a shell

### Use
`chmod +x make_changes.sh`
`./make_changes.sh`

<br>
This will make the changes for the account that executes make_changes.sh.
To make changes for the root account, run with sudo.

Additional .cow's came from https://github.com/paulkaefer/cowsay-files/
