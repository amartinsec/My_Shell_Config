# My_Shell_Config
For my new VM's 

- Installs Oh-My-ZSH with custom funky theme
- Enables git, colorize, and catimg plugins
- Installs cowsay with  handselected .cow's
- Adds a nice fourtune quote in cowsay upon starting a shell

Additional .cow's came from https://github.com/paulkaefer/cowsay-files/
